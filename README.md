# stellaris-parser
Tech tree parser for Stellaris

This is a tool to read in the technology files in a specified path. Then
output events and an on_action file to be used in the game as a mod like
linear tech trees.

To do:
* Make a list of starter and repeatable techs and use them to skip
* Allow user requested techs to be added to the omitted tech file
* Load language files to give techs proper names
* (Maybe?) More information on tech bubbles, like area, tier, whether it's repeatable, etc.
