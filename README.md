# stellaris-parser
Tech tree parser for Stellaris

This is a tool to read in the technology files in a specified path. Then
output events and an on_action file to be used in the game as a mod like
linear tech trees(http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=955364064).

To do:
* Make a list of starter, rare, and repeatable techs and use them to skip.
* Allow user requested techs to be added to the omitted tech file.
* Load language files to give techs proper names in on_action list.
* Gui interface to allow for easy use.
